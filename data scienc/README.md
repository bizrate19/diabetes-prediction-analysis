# Diabetes Data Preprocessing Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing diabetes dataset for predictive analytics in healthcare.

## Business Need
Early detection of diabetes can significantly reduce complications and healthcare costs. This project addresses the critical need for clean, well-structured medical data.

## Dataset Features
- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration (mg/dL)

- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (kg/m²)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
- Age: Age in years
- Outcome: Target variable (0 = non-diabetic, 1 = diabetic)
